## Introduction
This documentation provides an in-depth explanation of the implementation details of the  Notes app, a simple Android app built using Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes.

## Getting Started
To run the Notes app on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `<repository_url>`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## App Architecture
The app follows a basic architecture, consisting of the following main components:
- `MainActivity`: The entry point of the app.
- `Note`: A data class representing a note.
- `readNotesFromFile()`: Function to read notes from a file.
- `writeNotesToFile()`: Function to write notes to a file.
- `removeNoteFromFile()`: Function to remove a note from the file.
- `NotesApp`: The main composable function for the app UI.
- `NotesCard`: Composable function to display individual note cards.

## Data Handling
The app uses simple file-based data handling to read and write notes. Notes are stored in a text file named `notes.txt`. The `Note` data class is used to represent individual notes.

## User Interface
The user interface is built using Jetpack Compose, providing a modern and declarative way to create UI components. The app consists of the following main UI components:
- A scrollable list of notes displayed using `LazyColumn`.
- A button to switch between edit mode and view mode.
- An input field for adding notes.

## Composable Functions
### NotesApp
The `NotesApp` is the main composable function responsible for displaying the app's user interface. It takes a list of saved notes as a parameter and displays them using `LazyColumn`. The function includes the logic for adding, editing, and deleting notes.

### NotesCard
The `NotesCard` composable function is used to display individual note cards. It takes a `Note` object and a callback function for deleting notes as parameters. The function creates a card with the note's content and a delete button.

## Preview
A preview of the app's UI is provided using Jetpack Compose's `@Preview` annotation. The `Show` composable function is used to display the app UI with empty notes for preview purposes.

By following this documentation, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of the  Notes app's implementation, including its architecture, data handling, user interface, and composable functions.
